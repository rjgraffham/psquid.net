And all through the house, not a creature was stirring - except for me,
generating [my new GPG public key][1], with finding a use for it being an
informal resolution for the future (not really a New Year's resolution,
since I'd prefer to start before then if I find something).

Feel free to add it to your keyrings, or whatever your PGP client happens to
use, and I *will* guarantee that if I *am* using GPG at all, then that's the
keypair I'll be using, so in the unlikely event that someone tries to
impersonate me for whatever reason, they wouldn't have that key, and you'd
know something was up.

PSquid/Bit (depending on how you know me best :P) out!
