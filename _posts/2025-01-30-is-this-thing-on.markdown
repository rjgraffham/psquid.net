So I may have slightly stopped updating this blog for over a decade. Ah well,
it happens.

I don't know if I'll be posting to it any time soon, outside of this update,
but on the off chance someone is still subscribed to the Atom feed despite it
disappearing for years and years, hello again!

This is also the first time the Jekyll version of this blog has been hosted
on my own server, since tying it into my NixOS server config gives me a nice
easy way to have it track updates to the repo.

See you all around, possibly sooner than another decade from now!
