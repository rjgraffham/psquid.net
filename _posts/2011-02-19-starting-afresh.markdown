***NOTE: This post was originally posted on [my tumblr blog][1]. It has been
imported here for posterity's sake, in case tumblr ever deletes my account for
inactivity/ceases to exist/is taken over by trained apes.***

Unfortunately, in the process of migrating from an old VPS to a shiny new one,
my Wordpress posts were not, as I had originally thought, backed up. Now, I
intended to move to tumblr anyway, but it would've been nice to bring my posts
with me.

Still, there was nothing I couldn't do without, and hopefully the fact that
tumblr is not hosted on my server (it would fall over a lot more often if it
was) will help avert such missteps in future.

And, honestly? It feels rather nice to start 2011's blogging with a clean
slate. Obviously, this blog is not yet fully set up, but that should happen
over the next few days or so.

PSquid out.
