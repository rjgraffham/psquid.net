Sounds delicious!

But in all seriousness, hello, and welcome to my new blog!

It's back on my server, instead of tumblr, and this time, it's completely coded by me, from the engine (SquidInk) all the way up to the theme (the titular "Ink 'n' Mustard"). Which means that I get any and every feature I could possibly want, because _all I have to do is write it_ (scratching one's own itches is so very satisfying).

I'm also using this move back to spur me into getting some more posting done, so keep your eyes peeled for more soon.
